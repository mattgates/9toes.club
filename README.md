# jterm-dis

This is my January term Directed Independent Study project. The end goal will be a CRUD app that should be capable of users registering, logging in/out, sharing recipes, and viewing recipes made by others.

## About the project

All of the front and backend has been done using JavaScript and mainly using the React library. I've also created an API with express that manages all of the communication with MongoDB Atlas. The API currently runs on one port and the React App runs on another with a proxy to the API for fetch calls.

The project will be running at 9toes.club as soon as the Raspberry Pi is all setup. That's another part of the project in which I'll be hosting the website on a Pi to gain some experience with that in addition to full stack development.
